This read me file describes the output files and R-scripts accompanying the manuscript entitled:
"Disparities in cervical cancer elimination time frames in the United States: a comparative modeling study"
by Emily A. Burger et al.

There are six files in total, described as follows:
1. "BurgerJansen2024_JNCI_Model_outputs.xlsx" - The main output file that contains all the model outputs for all scenarios. Please refer to the readme sheet in the file for more details

2. "Make beta distribution (Figure S1).R" - The R script used to generate the cumulative inverse beta distribution (Figure S1). Does not need any data to function

3. "Script for Figure 2 and Figure S3.R" - The R script used to generate Figure 2 (main outcome figure of the manuscript) and Figure S3. Requires "Elimination_timings_main.txt"

4. "Script for Figure S2.R" - The R script used to generate Figure S2. Requires "Elimination_timings_supplement.txt"

5. "Elimination_timings_main.txt" - A datafile that contains the outcomes from the main excelsheet ("BurgerJansen2024_JNCI_Model_outputs.xlsx"),
organized so that it can be used to generate the graphs

6. "Elimination_timings_supplement.txt" - A datafile that contains the outcomes from the main excelsheet ("BurgerJansen2024_JNCI_Model_outputs.xlsx"),
organized so that it can be used to generate the graphs
